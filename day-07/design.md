# Log Analyzer

## What is the problem ?
- Application server contains many entries like 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR' messages. 
- Manually counting logs is time-consuming and can cause human errors.

## What input does it need ?
- User need to provide a file name for which we want to count the logs from.
- Provide the file name if needed to store the result.

## What output we can expect ?
- Prints the log counts output on terminal.
- Store the result in some file if needed. 

## What steps are involved ?
- first read the provided file 
- Now count the logs from the file i.e. 'INFO','WARNING','ERROR' etc.
- store the result in some file if needed or can directly print the output in terminal.
